The program is ment to check multiple files for word spelling correctness.

You run it with: "./main", then the program shows wether the internal dictionary was loaded or not, if it was successfully loaded, it prompts you with "Provide a filepath: ".
If you provide "somefile.txt" as addictional argument, it loads it as a custom dictionary instead. So that you can spellcheck files in different languages. The default 
language is English.

When you enter a path, it spellchecks the file (if it exists) and returns positions (line number, start char pos on that line) of the words that were misspelled or prints 
"Text does not contain any misspellings\n".
If there are more than 100 misspellings it outputs the first 100 and at the end it prints "More were misspelled, but were hidden in order
not to overflow the console\n".

At the end of each spellcheck it prints out overall misspellings count and how much time the spellchecking took.

It can be used multiple times.

It can be exited with "exit" command (user is notified about it after each successful spellcheck).



Step-by-step:

1. Load dictionary. If a file provided, load from it instead. If its not found, return file not found exception.
If failed to load from existing file, return an exception: "Is empty" if file is empty, "Failed to load" if unknown load failure occurred.
2. Spellcheck file word by word, while keeping track of lines and char positions. If file not found, print "File not found"
If file is empty, print "File is empty, nothing to check"
3. Print out the result: Number of words misspelled, number of total words
4. Continue over until user types in "exit"
